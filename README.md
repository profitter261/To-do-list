# To-do-list
This project is about the total front-end web development of a simple application which is a to-do list
A To-Do List Application is a simple yet effective way to manage daily tasks, improving productivity and organization. The provided code implements a basic web-based to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to add and remove tasks dynamically.

The HTML structure consists of an input field for entering tasks and a button to add them to the list. Each task is displayed within an unordered list, where users can remove tasks with a delete button. The CSS styling enhances the application's appearance by adding a visually appealing layout with a gradient background, rounded task items, and a neatly arranged task list. The design also incorporates a background image, custom fonts, and a well-structured layout to make the interface user-friendly.

The JavaScript functionality is minimal but efficient. The addTask() function retrieves the user input, creates a new list item, and appends it to the task list. Each task item also includes a dynamically generated delete button with an embedded SVG icon. The removeTask() function ensures that when a user clicks the delete button, the corresponding task is removed from the list.

This implementation provides a basic yet customizable to-do list, allowing for future enhancements like task completion status, local storage for task persistence, or even integration with a backend for user authentication and data management.

A To-Do List Application is a simple yet powerful tool that helps users organize tasks efficiently. It allows users to add, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed, making task management easy.
